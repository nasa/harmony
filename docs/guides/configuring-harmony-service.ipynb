This will take care of much of the boilerplate configuration/code covered in this notebook.\n",

    "Harmony uses records in the Common Metadata Repository ([CMR](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search)) to determine which services are to be used for which collection. There are several Unified Metadata Model (UMM) record types that are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [UMM-C](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/EMFD/repos/unified-metadata-model/browse/collection): Collection records, which contain information describing the collection itself, such as native file information, instrumentation or observing campaign used to take the data.\n",
    "* [UMM-G](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/EMFD/repos/unified-metadata-model/browse/granule): Granule records, with specific information on an individual file within a collection. For example, spatial or temporal extents.\n",
    "* [UMM-Var](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/EMFD/repos/unified-metadata-model/browse/variable): Variable records, detailing individual variables that are common to granules within the same collection. For example, sea surface temperature, or longitude.\n",
    "* [UMM-S](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/EMFD/repos/unified-metadata-model/browse/service): Service records, that provide information on a back-end service that can be called to retrieve or transform hosted data. These records also help EDSC to configure the options presented to their users in order to make a valid request to these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding further, you should have granules ingested by a [Cumulus](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus) instance. These granules should each have a UMM-G record and be within a collection with a UMM-C record, hosted in a CMR provider. It is not required for Harmony to utilize cloud-hosted data ingested via Cumulus, but it is strongly recommended to reduce egress cost.\n",
    "\n",

    "[earthdata-varinfo](https://github.com/nasa/earthdata-varinfo) is a Python package designed to map the variables within a file, or an OPeNDAP DMR file, and the interdependencies between those variables.

For complete documentation regarding generating and publishing UMM-Var records, please see [this notebook documentation](https://github.com/nasa/earthdata-varinfo/blob/main/docs/how_to_publish_to_cmr_with_earthdata_varinfo.ipynb).\n",
