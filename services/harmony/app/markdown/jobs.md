### <a name="jobs-details"></a>  Monitoring Jobs with the Jobs API and the Workflow-UI

Jobs can be monitored using the jobs API as well as with the [Workflow-UI](/workflow-ui) web application.

There are two set of jobs API endpoints with the same sub paths and parameters: one with path `jobs` to view and control the current user's own jobs; the other with `admin/jobs` path to view and control all users' jobs if the current user has admin permission to do so. For simplicity, we will only list the ones for regular user below.

#### Getting the list of jobs for a user

```

{{root}}/jobs

```
**Example {{exampleCounter}}** - Getting the user's list of jobs using the `jobs` API

Returns the list of Harmony jobs submitted by the user. By default, 10 jobs are returned in the response. User can use the paging query parameters to page through the whole result set or/and change the number of jobs that will be returned in each page.

##### <a name="query-parameters"></a> Query Parameters
| parameter | description                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| page      | Current page number         |
| limit     | Number of jobs in each page |
| label     | Filters jobs to those which include at least one of the labels specified. Multiple labels can be specified using a comma-separated list.|

**Table {{tableCounter}}** - Harmony jobs endpoint parameters

##### <a name="jobs-response"></a> Response
The returned JSON response will list the total number of jobs that belong to the user, details of the jobs on the current page and links to traverse to the previous, next, first or last pages of the result set:

| field | description                                                                                                            |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| count | Total number of jobs                                                                                                   |
| jobs  | A list of JSON objects with fields describe the job in details. For details, see [job status response](#job-response). |
| links | A list of links to traverse to the previous, next, first or last pages of the result set.                              |

#### Pausing a job

User can pause a job with the following API call. The returned response is the same as the [job status response](#job-response) with the job status as `paused`.

```

{{root}}/jobs/<job-id>/pause

```
**Example {{exampleCounter}}** - Pausing a running job


#### Resuming a paused job

User can resume a paused job with the following API call. The returned response is the same as the [job status response](#job-response) with the job status as `running`.

```

{{root}}/jobs/<job-id>/resume

```
**Example {{exampleCounter}}** - Resuming a paused job


#### Canceling a job

User can cancel a job with the following API call. The returned response is the same as the [job status response](#job-response) with the job status as `canceled`.

```

{{root}}/jobs/<job-id>/cancel

```
**Example {{exampleCounter}}** - Canceling a running job


#### Skipping preview

Jobs involving many granules will by default pause automatically after the first few
granules are processed. This allows the user to examine the output to make sure things
look right before waiting for the entire job to complete. If things looks good, the
user can resume the paused job, if not they can cancel the paused job.

**Note:** The current threshold in this environment for the number of granules that will trigger automatic pausing of a job is **{{previewThreshold}}**.

If a user wishes to skip this step they can pass the `skipPreview` flag mentioned in the
[Services API section](#using-the-service-apis), or they can tell an already running job
to skip the preview using the following:

```

{{root}}/jobs/<job-id>/skip-preview

```
