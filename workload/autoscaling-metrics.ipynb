The focus on synchronous requests was delaying work on the asynchronous ones, so clearly we needed more resources when there are 50 concurrent requests in the system.\n",

We should repeat the test to make sure it wasn't some difference on the download site, but if so it might mean we should increase the number of nodes or decrease the number of pods we allow. "
